3.0.0
	Input image is a single image. LSTM is at the end of the FCN layer, right before the final layer. LSTM has 5 steps per image crop and 128 hidden states. Weights are locked, only LSTM at the end of the FCN can be trained, as well as the softmax layer.

3.0.1
	Fixed last layer by adding isRelu false, removing relu activation for last fully connected layer

build_imagenet_data.py - for all images
build_imagenet_data_bboxonly.py 
	- only bbox
	- main difference is the if statement that checks if bbox is [] (no coordinates)
build_imagenet_data_validation.py - only validation
