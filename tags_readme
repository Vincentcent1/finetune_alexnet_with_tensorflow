3.0.0
	Input image is a single image. LSTM is at the end of the FCN layer, right before the final layer. LSTM has 5 steps per image crop and 128 hidden states. Weights are locked, only LSTM at the end of the FCN can be trained, as well as the softmax layer.

3.0.1
	Fixed last layer by adding isRelu false, removing relu activation for last fully connected layer

3.1.1
	Fixed wrong import and input and output dimension in alexnetRNN_single_lockedWeights.py

3.2.0
    Use all data for training, input image is a single image, locked weights, lstm after FCN
    filename:
        finetune_tfrecords_FCRNN_single_locked_all.py
3.3.0
    Use all data for training, 5 crops, locked weights, lstm after FCN
    filename:
        finetune_tfrecords_FCRNN_locked_all.py
3.4.0
    3.3.0 but with adaptive learning rate that reduces by 2 if there is no improvement
    filename:
        finetune_tfrecords_adaptive_FCRNN_locked_all.py 

build_imagenet_data.py - for all images and no check for bbox
build_imagenet_data_all1.py - for all images and there is a check for bbox, if there is no bbox, bbox coordinates becomes all 0.0
build_imagenet_data_bboxonly.py 
	- only bbox
	- main difference is the if statement that checks if bbox is [] (no coordinates)
build_imagenet_data_validation.py - only validation

datagenerator_tfrecords.py - This datagenerator returns one output per image or tfrecords only for tfrecords with bboxes. Data taken from tfrecords with only bboxes.
datagenerator_tfrecords_RNN.py - This datagenerator returns 5 output per image with crops from left-top, right-top, left-bottom, right-bottom and center. Data taken from tfrecords with only bboxes.
datagenerator_tfrecords_RNN_all.py - This datagenerator returns one output per image or tfrecords for all tfrecords (tfrecords_all folder). Data taken from all tfrecords.
